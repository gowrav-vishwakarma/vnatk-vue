You can change the scope to deal with further options coming. title String [Optional] Provides title of your crud quicksearch Array/Function/Boolean [Optional] quicksearch adds a input box at top-right of crud and allws you to search in your data. quicksearch: true will search in your local crud data. (Client side only.) quicksearch: ['field1', 'field2'] This format will work if your pagination is set to server mode, vnatk-crud will perform a like query on the fields provided with user entered value and results will filter in crud. quicksearch: (usertext)=>{ // do some change in read.modeloptions as per your need } when given as function you can modify crud options based on usertext and vue reactivity will reload crud with new options. create Boolean/JSON [Optional] - default true When provided just boolean, you just inform if you want to have a create facility or not. true : If true, system will add a add button and will get all Sequelize Model fields with their relations to have a create form populated. on save it does add record too. false : If false, system will skip add facility for your crud. json : When provided a json object you can customize create feature, let's see json object options in detail create.uititle String [Optional] Title of Dialog opened create.modeloptions JSON [Optional] - default {} Model options to be passed to Sequelize model.create( HERE ) crudoptions:{ service: customer, model: 'User' create: { modeloptions: { attributes: [\"name\", \"email\", \"status\", \"city_id\", \"password\"], }, } } create.defaultvalues JSON/Function [Optional] - default {} Lets say you are showing Users that are employee only so you are using crudoptions.read.modeloptions.modelscope:'employee' But when you create a new User, you don't want to add userType in create form but this should go as default value. You can do this by following example Default value as String crudoptions:{ service: customer, model: 'User' create: { modeloptions: { attributes: [\"name\", \"email\", \"status\", \"city_id\", \"password\"], }, defaultvalues:{ userType:'employee' } } } Default value as function any default value can be provided by function also to do some logic on your data going to submit and set your default value based on that logic crudoptions:{ service: customer, model: 'User' create: { modeloptions: { attributes: [\"name\", \"email\", \"status\", \"city_id\", \"password\"], }, defaultvalues:{ userType: function(item){ // your logic here like // if email contains company-domain.com return 'employee' // else return 'user' // A return value is must to have } } } } read JSON [Optional] - default {} Provides information to vnatk-express-seuelize and vnatk-vue to handle your data. You can customize read options by JSON properties. read.modeloptions JSON [Optional] - default {} Options for yous sequelize model, Wiht a few minor modifications, you can almost use any Sequelize model's option here what you can use in model.findAll (if not using serversidepagination) or you can use in model.findAndCountAll . Three things are surely different then those model options are how we define operators , scope and sequelize.fn in our read.modeloptions For operator - Use operator alias for operators like in example below For scope - Since you define model with string the main model scope is defined by crudoptions.read.modelscope property and for include options in your modeloptions you can define separate scope property to be populated at server side. For fn - you can pass json object with fn, col and as property to rebuild sequelize.fn at server side Lets have an exmaple to do it now. Please read all the comments to get more about read.modeloptions read: { modeloptions: { subQuery:false, attributes: [ \"name\", \"email\", \"status\", \"state_id\", \"city_id\", \"mobile\", ], // include: [\"City\", \"State\"], // to get all attributes with including without any further customizing (Same as sequelize docs) include: [ { model: \"City\", attributes: [\"name\", \"status\"], // get only these attributes (Same as sequelize docs) required: false, // To have OUTER LEFT JOIN instead INNER JOIN (Same as sequelize docs) scope: false, // or text (since we define Models as string, scope can be passed as property here) (VNATK-SPECIFIC ) }, { model: \"State\", attributes: [\"name\", \"status\", \"gst_code\"], required: false, }, { // No relations and wrong models but just to write somewhere till we create proper documentation model: \"Project\", as: \"ProjectsOwned\", attributes: [{ fn: \"count\", col: \"*\", as: \"ProjAdminCount\" }], }, { model: \"Project\", as: \"Projects\", attributes: [ { fn: \"count\", col: \"*\", as: \"ProjectPartOf\", through: { attributes: [] }, }, ], }, ], group: [\"User.id\"], }, } read.modelscope Boolean/String [Optional] - undefined Remember this option effects main model defined in crudoptions while individual scopes in include are just with scope property undefined or not defined : If not defined, the VES will apply defaultscope like what would sequelize do. false : set this value to false, model at the server end will be unscoped. String : if set as any string, system will load the scope by defined name, if not found at server model, system will throw an error. read.autoderef Boolean [Optional] - default true VNATK finds relations at server side with sequelize models and solves relations to get de-referenced data here. Liek if user belongsTo City, autderef will also return you the city name by including this attribute by default and also shows in crud. You have total control over this also how to display what, that will come in later options. But if you want to skip it doing all de-ref for you, just set it false. remember setting this false will also result in all Autocomplete etc not working automatically. read.serversidepagination Boolean [Optional] - default false The default behaviour is to get all data and do the pagination at client side, but if the data is big or you want serverside pagination, just set this option to true. rest limit, page number etc will be taken care of. For better understanding please see datatableoptions exmaple. read.datatableoptions JSON [Optional] - default from v-data-table This is synced option with v-data-table options, so you can use the same options here what you use for v-data-table like serversidepagination: true, datatableoptions: { page: number, itemsPerPage: number, sortBy: string[], sortDesc: boolean[], groupBy: string[], groupDesc: boolean[], multiSort: boolean, mustSort: boolean }, update Boolean/JSON [Optional] - default true if set to false, Editing option will be unavailable for the crud. if provided with JSON object, you can customize Editing feature. TO edit any field, you must have that in your read.modeloptions.attributes or the system will throw error update.uititle String [Optional] Title of Editing Window update.modeloptions Mostly used to define what fields you want to edit, rest options will be just passed to your sequelize model. update: { uititle: \"Edit User - {name}\", modeloptions: { attributes: [ \"name\", \"email\", \"status\", \"city_id\", // If autoderef is true, these relations will be converted to autocomplete automatically \"state_id\", \"mobile\", ], }, }, delete Boolean [Optional] - default true If set to false, system will remove deleting facility from crud. action Boolean [Optional] - default true If set to true, VES (vue-express-sequelize) will send all doable actions and the related actions will be visible in CRUD. To skip having actions fetched set this value to false . To read about how you can define actions from sequelize model, Please see Sequelize Model Features ui JSON [Optional] - default undefiend defines options for crud, like default action placement place and headers for v-data-table ui.defaultActionPlacement String[DropDown/buttonGroup] [Optional] - default DropDown Where by default you want your actions to be placed in crud, DropwDown will add them in menu at the end of Row, buttonGroup will add actions in buttons in action column. ui.headers Array of Objects [Optional] - default undefined Vantk-crud retrives all headers from sequelize itself, You can even override headers by other options, but many times overriding will be more work to do if you need to show only 2 columns and to hide rest 15 columns, just replace headers coming from server by defining here ui: { defaultActionPlacement: \"DropDown\", // Skip headeres received from server and use these as base to mix with override later headers: [ { text: \"Identifier\", value: \"identifier\", }, { text: \"Attribute Group\", value: \"AttributeGroup.name\", }, { // Don't forget to add actions column manually in case of heaers defined in ui and // actions: true (default) text: \"Actions\", value: \"vnatk_actions\", }, ], }, override JSON [Optional] - default undefined you can always override actions and headers to customize your own need. You just have to override only actions/headers that you want to modify. override.actions Array of Objects define what actions you want to override, each object in this array must have a name property to identify which action to override and rest properties shows what to override. vnatk has a few predefined reserved action names vnatk_add vnatk_edit vnatk_delete To create forms at runtime fromsequelize model details VNATK is using Vuetify-Form-Base a great plugin to convert your json as beautiful vuetify forms. It will always be a great help to study that also. Lets have an complete example and then go each option one by one. Please read comments for better unerstaing in the examples override: { actions: [ { name: \"vnatk_edit\", // edit action is given specially this name placeIn: \"buttonGroup\", // or \"DropDown\" // use this to merge formschema options formschemaoverrides: { mobile: { label: \"Mobile Number\", }, city_id: { // titlefield - only used if field is reference/association type // default titlefield is considered as name or as defined in sequelize model titlefield: \"City.name\", // autocomplete text field from recived data label: \"Your City\", serviceoptions: { service: customer, // To have data from other service then default service defined for crud basepath: \"/vnatk\", model: \"City\", modelattributes: [\"id\", \"name\"], searchfield: \"name\", // autocomplete search q for like in the field limit: 10, }, }, email: { clearable: true, }, // state_id: { // titlefield: \"State.name\", // no state_id related info is overrided, still working good, in this case: using same service to get details if id,name is required with default limit // }, }, }, { name: \"vnatk_add\", // add action is given specially this name // use this to merge formschema options formschemaoverrides: { city_id: { label: \"Your City ... \", }, }, }, { name: \"activate\", placeIn: \"buttonGroup\", // or \"DropDown\" icon: \"mdi-format-align-left\", caption: \"Activate User\", // formschema:{} // use this to override complete formschema // formschemaoverrides:{} // use this to merge formschema options }, { name: \"deactivate\", placeIn: \"buttonGroup\", caption: \"Deactivate\", // icon: \"mdi-format-align-left\", }, { name: \"clientFunction\", type: \"NoRecord\", execute: this.clientFunctionCallBack, isClientAction: true, }, ], } override.actions[].name String [Mandatory] Used to identify whcih action to override override.actions[].placeIn String[buttonGroup/DropDown] [Optional] - default DropDown where you want to place the action, in dropdown menu at the end of row or in buttonGroup. override.actions[].formschemaoverrides JSON [Optional] VES, sends actions and their schema well defined from server, but many times you want to override its scham at client side based on need. you can override each field's schema by defineing field_id as key and JSON schema to be overrided as value. Remember, only values that you override will be overrided and rest values will be taken as recieved from server. please see override.actions for complete example. override.headers JSON [Optional] VES sends all related headrs via initial server call, still you need to hide/add extra header through this options Lets have a full exmaple of override.headers option, please read the comments for better understanding VES also sends one header valued vnatk_actions to render all actions in it, you can override that too. override: { actions: [ ... ], headers: { /* field:{ option: value } */ city_id: { hide: true, // vnatk specific property to hide a column in v-data-table }, state_id: { hide: true, }, mobile: { text: \"User Mobile\", sortable: true, // value: \"mobile\", // moveto: 0, }, City: { // Override DeReferanced Fields (received from server due to autoderef) text: \"Primary City\", //Overrided header caption/text value: \"City.name\", // Value does not have effect as alrady overrided column by slot in template above // moveto: 2, }, \"State.gst_code\": { text: \"State GST Code\", value: \"State.gst_code\", sortable: true, moveto: 4, }, vnatk_actions: { moveto: \"last\", }, }, }, import JSON [Optional] - default undefined If defined as JSON, your crud will have an import button at top to import data. Data will previewed first and when proceeded, sent to VES for importing into defined model at root option. Also you can restructure data as seqlize relations and all deep data create with all relations will be done at server. Lets have an complete example and then understand each option. If using import don't forget to use vue-papa-parse to use either on your component or globally on Vue instance <script> import Vue from \"vue\"; import VuePapaParse from \"vue-papa-parse\"; Vue.use(VuePapaParse); . . . crudoptions:{ . . , import: { service: catalog, basepath: \"/admin/vnatk\", model: \"User\", execute: \"vnatk_import\", // or any other funtion you want to pass this data to in your model autoimport: true, // ignores execute options and just try to bulk create from given data by default vnatk action transaction: \"file\", // defaults to 'file' / or 'row'.

This way, you can define arrange data from flat csv/excel data to Strcutured data. For example please see import options. rowformatter allowes you to add $vnatk_ properties in root iyem as well as all nested data, next section describes what are those $vnatk_ handlers for import. import.errorhandler function [Optional] - default undefined VV try to manage coming errors well, but in case you want to handle errors by your won, you can create this property Returned String will be shown at the top of import preview page. import: { autoimport: true, rowformatter: function (item) { // set default values in importer item.userType = \"employee\"; return item; }, errorhandler: function (err) { return err.response.data.Exception.errors .map((e) => e.message) .join(\"<br/>\"); }, }, $vantk_ handlers explained You can add the following $vnatk_ properties in importing row items (at root level as well as nested level) This will guide VES how you want to treat a particular relation or row. $vnatk_data_handle : This property has following options to be passed as string values alwaysCreate : with this option, importer will always insert data in table findOrCreate : with this option, importer will try to find record in table based on all fields values, if found no data will be inserted. For relations (Nested belongsTo, belongsTomany) founded Id will be used to make relations. if you have another criteria to search not by all fields, you can set $vnatk_find_options findAndUpdateOrCreate : with this option, importer will find (Either by all fields or as per $vnatk_find_options if defined) and if found, values for item will be updated. If not found the record will be instered. For relations, if not created, founded record primary key will be used to set relations as per data. findToAssociate : with this option, importer will find record by all fields or as per $vnatk_find_options if defined. If found record will be used to associate, like importing users and associating them with existing City. But if not found, this throws error. associateIfFound : with this option, importer will try to find record by all fields or as per $vnatk_find_options if defined. If found record will be used to associate, like importing users and associating them with existing Group. But if not found, importer will simply skip association. $vnatk_find_options : This property has following options to be passed as string values. If defined, this option guides importer to find a record. If not defined system will find by all items. ike, if you want to find a City, if not found want to create it with status Active. What if the City is already in database but deactivated, you don;t want to find by name and status. modelscope : false to unscope model before finding, or String to set scope for model. modeloptions : JSON , provides where condition for find. This only allows you to define where condition, attributes or include are not permitted here. import.success function|callback [Optional] - default undefined If defined, once importer is finished with importing, this function will be called by passing response data from VES API. Crud Events vnatk-crud extends v-data-table from Vuetify, Hence, all attributes and events on v-data-table should work here too. In addition to this vnatk-crud emits two events. before-action-execute This event emits just before any action is about to execute passing two parameters action object and item object. <vnatk-crud :options=\"crudoptions\" @before-action-execute='function1', > . . . <script> export default { . . . methods: { function1(action, item){ // DO YOUR STUFF HERE } } } </script> after-action-execute This event emits when responce is recieved and success callbacl is called.
